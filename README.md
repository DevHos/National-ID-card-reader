# Description
Copying information from national ID card is needed in each and every place we go to everyday, either to record it or to fill it in an application form. An error in only one digit can delay an urgent process for days.   
Therefore, it is necessary to develop software capable of scanning the card rapidly, and with high accuracy, extracting personal information from it, and providing this information to the user to reduce the time needed for copying along with typos.   
This project performs its tasks using Python Open-CV libraries.

# Inputs and Outputs
The software accepts photos of national ID cards captured using smart-phones or scanned with a scanner. It accepts photos with JPG, PNG, and JPEG extension; it generates a photo of a form in JPG format.  
  
  -Note: Make sure you capture a photo in good light conditions.
